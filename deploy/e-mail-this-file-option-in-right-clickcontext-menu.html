This should work for all Linux users with **Nautilus** file manager.

First install the package – “_nautilus-actions_“.

For Fedora, RHEL, Cent OS and other RPM based distributions
`yum install nautilus-actions`

For debian based distributions
`apt-get install nautilus-actions`

Fire “_Nautilus Action Editor GUI_” either from _System -> Preferences -> Nautilus Actions Configuration_ or from command line:
`open nautilus-actions-config-tool`

From the tool-bar (below menubar), use the first button to ‘_Define a new action_‘. In the ‘Context Label’ field seen on the ‘Action’ tab, use something like ‘**E-mail this file**‘. And then switch to the ‘_Command_‘ tab and follow the following steps for your choice of e-mail client:

For using **Evolution** as the e-mail client:
In the ‘_Command_‘ tab, use ‘evolution’ in the _Path_ field. And in the next Parameters field:
`mailto:?attach=%u`
%u gives the file path in runtime.

For using **Thunderbird** as the e-mail client:
Now, navigate to the ‘_Command_‘ tab, and in the path filed, use ‘thunderbird’. The next one is ‘_Parameters_‘ field where we use
`'-compose 'attachment=%u'` .
%u gives the file path in runtime.

We save the changes by clicking on the second button on the tool-bar.

And, optionally, make it cleaner: _Tools -> Preferences -> Runtime Preferences -> Nautilus Menu Layout_ Deselect _“Create a root ‘Nautilus-Actions’ menu”_ and _“Add an About Nautilus-Actions’ item…”_

_OK_ and close the window.

Probably, we are done. Just in case the item isn’t visible, please find a way to restart Nautilus.

This post is a straight forward set of instructions on how you can configure MythTV to run without a TV tuner or capture card.

My current ADSTech TV tuner isn’t supported by MythTV due to driver issues. So, I have ordered a Hauppauge TV tuner which I am getting very soon. Although I had no plans of using MythTV just for local music and video playback, I couldn’t wait to try and see why it is so popular. Configuring MythTV to run without any identified TV capture card wasn’t that straight-forward and I thought sharing it would help someone else besides serving as a cheatsheet for myself.

# Installing MythTV

On Fedora, CentOS, RHEL and other rpm based distros:  
`yum -y install mythtv`

For Ubuntu:  
`sudo apt-get install mythtv`

# Setup

Launch setup with `mythtv-setup`.

Navigate to `2. Capture Cards`  
Select `(New Capture Card)`  
For `Card Type`, select `Demo test recorder` and leave `File path` field empty. Hit `Finish`.

Use `Esc` key whenever you need to go one level back. Pressing `Esc`now takes us to the main menu.

From the setup main menu, navigate to `4\. Video sources`.  
Select `(New Video Source)`  
Fill in `Video source name` with `Empty`.

Select `No grabber` for `Listings Grabber`.  
Hit `Finish`.

Now that we have created card and source, we need to connect them.  
From the main menu, navigate to `5\. Input connections`.  
The `Demo` capture device is currently attached to none.  
Press `Enter` key to edit this connection and select `Empty` from the pulldown.  
Hit `Next` and then `Finish` to save this connection.

From the main menu, select`6\. Channel Editor` and then click `Add New Channel`.  
Give a name for `Channel Name` and select empty from `Video Source` pulldown.  
Hit `Next` and then `Finish` to save this channel.

We can now exit the setup.

# Running MythTV

Start MythTV backend service with `mythbackend &`.  
The & after a process name pushes it to background.

Launch `mythfrontend`.

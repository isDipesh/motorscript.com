**If it is the first page of the document**,

- Press F11 to open _Styles and Formatting_.
- Click on the fourth icon on the top called _Page Styles_.
- Double-click _First Page_ from the list to apply the first page style where the headers and footers are hidden.

This method works only for the first page of the document. However a little more work makes it work for any page.

**For pages other than the first,**

- Go to the last line of the page that precedes the page where you want to hide headers and footers.
  (Go to last line of page 3, if you want headers and footers not to be shown in page 4).
- From the menu bar, select _Insert -> Manual Break_
- In the dialog, select _Page Break_ check-box from _Type_ and _First Page_ from _Style_ pull-down list.

The headers and footers are then hidden for the page that follows the manually inserted page break.

The installation is pretty smooth as is always with Anaconda. You get to choose which packages to install. Gnome, KDE, LXDE, XFCE, etc. are the desktop environment options available and I chose to install all. Installing more than 2000 packages from the DVD media didn’t take long!

After the one time post-installation configuration, I logged into Gnome 3\. I was very much disappointed to loose those features of Gnome 2 I was used to. More about the Gnome 3 interface, tips, customizations and extensions here in this separate post :

Firefox 4.0.1 comes with the distribution as the default web browser.
Empathy is the default IM client, so Pidgin lovers like me have to go through one more yum install command.
Also, banshee isn’t integrated, but Amarok and RhythmBox are available!

Dialogs in windows pop out of the title bar which isn’t a bad effect.

The system is very much stable, haven’t experience a single crash or bug problem yet. The system boots up pretty fast and resuming from hibernation is very very fast. The only disaapointment may be the change of UI in gnome 3, Fedora 15 is perfect otherwise.

Installing the essentials:

The commands listed in this thread are supposed to be run by a privileged user like the ‘root’ user.
I use Fedora as root user, not recommended though. But this is how you login as root:

Or if you feel insecure having all those powers, you may want to add yourself to the sudoers list and preceed all the commands that require super user permissions with ‘sudo ‘. Exercise!

Since Fedora is free, non-free packages like mp3 codecs and flash-player plugins are not be shipped with the distribution, which have to installed manually.

“RPM Fusion provides software that the Fedora Project or Red Hat doesn’t want to ship. That software is provided as precompiled RPMs for all current Fedora versions and Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5; you can use the RPM Fusion repositories with tools like yum and PackageKit.”

Install free and non-free repository from with:
`yum localinstall --nogpgcheck http://download1.rpmfusion.org/free/fedora/rpmfusion-free-release-stable.noarch.rpm http://download1.rpmfusion.org/nonfree/fedora/rpmfusion-nonfree-release-stable.noarch.rpm`

Install fastestmirror plugin for yum. Makes yum install packages from the fastest mirror.
`yum install yum-fastestmirror`

Install mp3 and other codecs:
Multimedia:
`yum -y install gstreamer-plugins-bad gstreamer-plugins-ugly xine-lib-extras-nonfree gstreamer-ffmpeg xmms xmms-mp3 xine xine-lib libdvdcss`

Install VLC:
yum -y install vlc
If you want VLC to run as root, see this thread :
[http://motorscript.com/compiling-vlc-for-root-users/](http://motorscript.com/compiling-vlc-for-root-users/ "http://motorscript.com/compiling-vlc-for-root-users/")

Install flash player and plugin for browsers:
`yum -y install gnash gnash-plugin`
OR if the non-free/properietary Adobe Flash player is to be installed:
`yum localinstall --nogpgcheck http://linuxdownload.adobe.com/adobe-release/adobe-release-i386-1.0-1.noarch.rpm -y
yum install flash-plugin
`

Install 7zip and RAR plugins and executables
`yum -y install p7zip p7zip-plugins unrar`

Most probably your wireless device is supported out of the box.
If it isn’t and if yours is a Broadcom WLAN device, follow this:
`yum install kmod-wl
service NetworkManager restart
service network restart
`

MySQL and phpmyadmin:
Follow these on terminal:
`yum install -y mysql phpmyadmin
chkconfig mysqld on
mysql_secure_installation
service mysqld restart`

The following scripts install Sublime Text 3 Build 3065 in Linux x64 and x32 systems. The scripts have been tested okay in Fedora 20.
All you need to do is to execute one of the following commands. This will also remove any existing version of Sublime Text from <code>/opt/sublime_text</code>.

For Linux x64:

<pre><code>wget -O install-sublime.sh https://gist.github.com/xtranophilist/5932634/raw/sublime-text-3-x64.sh &amp;&amp; sudo sh install-sublime.sh; rm -rf install-sublime.sh
</code></pre>

For Linux x32:

<pre><code>wget -O install-sublime.sh https://gist.github.com/xtranophilist/5932634/raw/sublime-text-3-x32.sh &amp;&amp; sudo sh install-sublime.sh; rm -rf install-sublime.sh
</code></pre>

**Note: I donâ€™t maintain this extension myself but [https://github.com/xtranophilist/gnome-shell-extension-sensors](https://github.com/xtranophilist/gnome-shell-extension-sensors.git) is regularly updated.

_gnome-shell-extension-sensors_ (previously known as gnome-shell-extension-cpu-temperature)  
is an extension for displaying CPU temperature, hard disk temperature, voltage and  
CPU fan RPM in GNOME Shell.

The extension uses [sensors](http://www.lm-sensors.org/) from lm_sensors package (lm-sensors for Debian systems)  
to read temperature for different CPU cores and adapters, voltage data and fan speed.  
If lm_sensors is not installed, temperature is read from [system files](https://github.com/xtranophilist/gnome-shell-extension-sensors/blob/master/extension.js#L234).

Optionally, this extension uses [hddtemp](https://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/hddtemp/) to read hard drive temperature data.

Installing <span class="hl">hdd-temp</span>:

`yum -y install hddtemp`

## Configuration

This extensions uses the output of <span class="hl">sensors</span>(1) command to obtain the

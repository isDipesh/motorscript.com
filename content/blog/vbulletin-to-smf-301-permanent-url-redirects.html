Switching to SMF from vbulletin is easy. The database converters are easily available. The only tricky part is to keep the old links alive, which isnâ€™t difficult either with a little regex knowledge and Apache mod_rewrite power.

Since this is a permanent switch, 301 redirects are used to send acknowldgements to web spiders. The old vbulletin installation used SEO friendly URLs and the new SMF has PrettyURLs Mod, which i think despite of no SMF experience at all is a must.

The following is the content from .htaccess file which should reside at the root directory of your forum.

**.htacess**

    RewriteEngine on
    RewriteBase /
    
    #Redirect www.mysite.com to mysite.com
    RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} ^www.mysite.com$ [NC]
    RewriteRule ^(.*)$ http://mysite.com/$1 [R=301]

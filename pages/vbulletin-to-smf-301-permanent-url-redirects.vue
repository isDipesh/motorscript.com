        Switching to SMF from vbulletin is easy. The
        database converters are easily available. The only tricky part is to
        keep the old links alive, which isnâ€™t difficult either with a little
        regex knowledge and Apache mod_rewrite power.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since this is a permanent switch, 301 redirects are used to send
        acknowldgements to web spiders. The old vbulletin installation used
        SEO friendly URLs and the new
        SMF has PrettyURLs Mod, which i think despite
        of no SMF experience at all is a must.
